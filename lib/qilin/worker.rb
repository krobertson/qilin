# before_fork/after_fork hooks.  See the Qilin::Configurator RDoc
# for examples.

  # the +after_fork+ hook after any priviledged functions need to be
  # run (e.g. to set per-worker CPU affinity, niceness, etc)

  # Any and all errors raised within this method will be propagated

  # invalid user/group and Errno::EPERM for insufficient priviledges

    # insufficient because modern systems have fine-grained
